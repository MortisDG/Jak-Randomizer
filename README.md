## For Streamers.
If you wanna play this mod, I included 2 files: effect.txt and timer.txt
Add them to OBS as a new text source and put it on "read from file" and pick both text files.
This will add the current effects and a timer (Remaining Time until new effect) on screen!

If there are any bugs or something else, let me know!

# Windows Defender might flag it as a Virus, just allow it on your PC and you're good to go!
